TO DO

PLOT DISTROBUTIONS OF NEURON STATS
	UNIVERITATE:														DONE
		HIST MEAN FIRING RATE
		HIST CV ISI
		HIST SW HALF
		HIST SW RETURN

	BIVARIATE:															DONE
		SCATTER: [CV ISI] [MEAN FIRING RATE]	COLOE = SW RETURN
		SCATTER: [MEAN FIRING RATE] [SW]		COLOR = CV ISI

	MULTIVARIATE:

		2D SCATTER: 2 PC FEATURES
		TSNE SCATTER

GROUP NEURONS:
	GROUP BY LITERATURE:			(arbirary cut offs based on juxta literature)
		CV ISI <= 0.55
		MFR <= 4.5

	UNSUPERVISED:
